<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.linegraph</em> is a primitive program to draw simple x,y line graphs
(plots) based on numerical data contained in separate files.


<h3>Data format</h3>

The X and Y data files for the graph are essentially a column of numbers in
each file, with one input number per line.  The program expects that each X
value will have a corresponding Y value, therefore the number of lines in
each data input file should be the same.  Essentially, the X data becomes
the X axis reference to which the Y data is plotted as a line. Therefore,
the X data should be a monotonically increasing progression of numbers (i.e.
"1,2,3,..."; "0, 10, 100, 1000,..."; "...-5,-1,0,1,5...").  If multiple Y
data files are used, the Y axis scale will be based on the range of minimum
and maximum values from all Y files, then all Y data given will be graphed
according to that Y scale. Therefore, if multiple Y data inputs are used
with dissimilar units, the graph produced comparing the two will be
deceptive.


<h3>File inputs</h3>

<p>
If <b>directory</b> option is provided, the paths to files can (and
should) be only relative paths to the files. This is not recommended
for scripting, but it can be advantageous when typing the paths
manually. For example when all the files are stored in the directory
<tt>/home/john/data</tt>, use can provide the following in the command
line:

<div class="code"><pre>
d.linegraph directory=/home/john/data x_file=x.txt y_file=y1.txt,y2.txt
</pre></div>


<h3>Managing colors</h3>

User can specify the <b>y_color</b> option, the <b>color_table</b>
option or just leave the defaults to influence the color of the
plotted lines.

<p>
Color specified by <b>y_color</b> option is used for drawing the lines
in the graph. If multiple Y data files are used, an equal number of
colors may be used to control the colors of the lines. Colors will be
assigned to Y data in respect to the sequence of instantiation on the
command line. It can be one of GRASS GIS named colors or the RGB
values from 0-255 separated by colon.

<p>
Alternatively, user can use <b>color_table</b> option to specify one
of the GRASS GIS predefined color tables.

<p>
By default, a series of colors will be chosen by the program if none are
provided upon invocation. Order of default colors is red, green,
violet, blue, orange, gray, brown, magenta, white, and indigo. User is
advised not to rely on the order of default colors and use <b>y_color</b>
or <b>color_table</b> option to obtain predictable and reproducible
results.

<p>
The color to be used for titles, axis lines, tics, and scale numbers
is determined by the <b>title_color</b> option.
User can provide one of the GRASS GIS named colors (such as gray, white, or black)
or use the GRASS GIS colon-separated format for RGB.

<h3>Titles, labels, and tics</h3>

The <b>title</b> option specifies the text for the title of the graph.
It will be centered over the top of graph.

The <b>x_title</b> option is a text to describe data for X axis. It will be
centered beneath the graph. Default is no text unless there is a need
for a unit descriptor determined by the <em>d.linegraph</em> module,
then string such as "in hundreds" is generated.

The <b>y_title</b> option is a text to describe data for Y axis. It
will be centered beneath the X data description. Similarly, to the
<b>x_title</b> option, default is no text unless there is a need for an
auto-generated description. In the case of graphs with multiple lines
(multiple inputs for Y axis), user may wish to use more specific text
placement using the <em><a href="d.text.html">d.text</a></em> or
<em><a href="v.label.html">v.label</a></em> programs.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

For historical reasons, the <em>d.linegraph</em> module accepts
titles of more than one word where the underscore character ("_")
is used to represent spaces (" "). For example "Census_data_1990"
would be printed over the graph as "Census data 1990". This is not
necessary to use as long as the parameter is quoted in the command line.
In general, this is not recommended to use and there is no need to use
it at all in Python or GUI.

<p>
The way the program locates and labels tic marks is less than perfect: 1)
although distances between Y tics is proportional to the value, they are
not proportional on the X axis; 2) decimal values between -1 and 1 can be
printed on the X axis, but not on Y. (With respect to the later, the input
for Y values can all be multiplied by a factor of 10 before graphing).

<p>
Depending on the user needs, it might be easier or more appropriate
to use a 3rd party tool such as xgraph, gnuplot, Matplotlib in Python,
or R instead of <em>d.linegraph</em>.
For a more general solution for plotting in GRASS GIS, user is
advised to use the <em><a href="d.graph.html">d.graph</a></em> module.


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

The following can be executed in Bash to create the input data for this
example. The user can just create these files in a text editor, save
them and specify path to them.

<div class="code"><pre>
cat > x.txt &lt;&lt;EOF
1
3
4
6
9
EOF
cat > y1.txt &lt;&lt;EOF
50
58
65
34
27
EOF
cat > y2.txt &lt;&lt;EOF
10
20
35
50
45
EOF
</pre></div>

<!--
export GRASS_FONT=sans  # fixes bad default font
d.mon start=cairo output=plot.png width=400 height=400 --o
d.erase  # previous image is not cleaned
-->

The series of commands creates a file <tt>plot.png</tt> in the current
directory which is the drawing make by <em>d.linegraph</em>.

<div class="code"><pre>
d.mon start=cairo output=plot.png width=400 height=400
d.linegraph x_file=x.txt y_file=y1.txt,y2.txt
d.mon stop=cairo
</pre></div>
